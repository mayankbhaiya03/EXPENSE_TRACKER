_**Expense Tracker**_
A simple full-stack Expense Tracker where users can create an account, log in, add their daily expenses, delete them, and see a bar chart of their last 6 months spending.
I built this project to practice full-stack development and learn how to deploy apps on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend)

_**Features**_
-> User authentication (Register + Login)
-> Add, view, and delete expenses
-> Categories like Food, Transportation, Shopping, Utilities, etc.
-> Last 6 months expense bar chart
-> Fully responsive UI
-> Backend API with JWT Auth
-> MongoDB Atlas as database
-> Frontend deployed on Vercel
-> Backend deployed on Render

_**Tech Stack**_
_Frontend_

-> React (Vite)
-> Tailwind CSS 
-> Fetch API

_Backend_

-> Node.js
-> Express.js
-> MongoDB + Mongoose
-> JWT Authentication

_Deployment_

Render → Backend
Vercel → Frontend

**Future Improvements**_

1. Add Budget Tracking
2. Export Expenses(PDF)
3. AI Spending Insights
